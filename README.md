# Final Assignment of the Course "Applied Data Science Capstone
## 1) Description of the problem
We deal with the following fictive scenario:
A friend of mine wants to move from Morocco to NYC to open an african restaurant. He asked me to analyze where in NYC to open it. It should be a place with an high density of african population. On the other hand the density of african restaurants should not be "too high".
## 2) Description of the Data
In order to find the best location for the restaurant we use data of NYC population from "Demographics of New York City" (Link: "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Demographics_of_New_York_City"). The data to analyze competition we get from Foursqauare API. On the basis of this data we try to find an optimum between the density of african population and competition which should be the best place to open the restaurant.
